That was Gandalf’s mark, of course, and the old man
was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due
mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real
business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the
Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one
of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement of
the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the
old man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only
appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long;
but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had
seen one of his firework displays – they now belonged to a
legendary past.
